# Hero Apps

# Description

This is a simple web application that simulates an app marketplace. Users can browse a list of applications, view detailed information about each app, and "install" or "uninstall" them. The installation status is saved locally in the browser's localStorage, making the user's choices persistent across sessions. The "My Installed Apps" page provides a centralized view of all installed applications and includes features for sorting.
